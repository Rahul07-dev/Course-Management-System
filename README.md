This is a short project that I developed as part of my Database Management Systems (DBMS) course. The project is based on implementing a few features such as authentication, file upload, hashing and permission levels into a course management system. This was meant to learn various concepts such as routing, handling session storage and password hashing.

Tech Stack - React, NodeJs and MySQL.
